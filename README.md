# Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Project

This repository contains the materials for the Week 4 project of Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.
It includes the R code, a codebook, and a tidy dataset produced as part of the assignment

# Files
1.**CodeBook.md**:This document provides detailed information on how to use the files, explanations of variables, descriptions of the data, and any data transformations or cleanup procedures applied.

2.**run_analysis.R**:This R script contains all the code necessary to perform the analyses outlined in the project's five steps.
You can execute it in RStudio by importing the file. Here's an overview of the five steps:

2.1.Merging the training and test datasets to create a unified dataset.

2.2.Extracting only the measurements related to mean and standard deviation for each measurement

2.3.Applying descriptive activity names to label the activities in the dataset.

2.4.Assigning descriptive variable names to the dataset.

2.5.Creating a second, independent tidy dataset that calculates the average of each variable for each activity and subject.

3.**tidy_Data.txt**:This file represents the final output of the project. 
It contains the tidy dataset generated in step 5, which includes the average of each variable for each activity and subject.

Please refer to the **CodeBook.md** for comprehensive instructions and details on using the files and understanding the dataset
